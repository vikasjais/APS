    "    - Is reasonable for smaller values for n and a single query. \n",
    "    - Space increases linearly (tree depth). \n",
    "    - Number of operations performed increases exponentially - $2^n$.\n",

    "2. **DP adaptation**\n",
    "    - Is best if you have a lot of queries in the range $(1,n),(1,k)$.\n",
    "    - Space and time are proportional to $n*k$.\n",

    "3. **Leaner DP**\n",
    "    - Is best if you have a lot of queries in the range $(1,k)$ for the same n. If n differs, it is probably best to use the 2<sup>nd</sup> method.\n",
    "    - Memory is an improvement over the 2<sup>nd</sup> approach - increases linearly with $k$ (overwrites same locations).\n",
    "    - Time complexity remains the same - $O(n*k)$."
